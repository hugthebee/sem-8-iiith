- Used a convolutional neural network (CNN)
- ResNet50 and partially fine-tuned the model
- Freezing early layers (all except layer3, layer4, and fc)
- Training only higher-level features and custom heads
- RandomRotation, ColorJitter, RandomResizedCrop â€“ data augmentation
- Higher emphasis on regionID prediction and lower on coordinated.
